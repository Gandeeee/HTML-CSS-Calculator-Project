## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built entirely with fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5:** Used to build the core structure of the calculator, including the container, display screen, and all the buttons.
* **CSS3:** Responsible for all styling and layout, including colors, button sizes, shadows (`box-shadow`), and a responsive design that looks great on various screen sizes.
* **JavaScript (Inline):** The calculator's logic is implemented directly within `onclick` attributes in the HTML. It handles user input and performs calculations using the `eval()` function.
